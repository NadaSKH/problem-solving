# DETERMINE IF A STRING HAS ALL UNIQUE CHARACHTERS WITHOUT USING ADDDITIONAL DATA STRUCTURE:

My first approach was brute force; by that I mean run two loops one checking the character and the other one checking the other charchters and comparing, if they became equal at any point then break and return false, otherwise return true. 
Time complexity (O(n2)).
